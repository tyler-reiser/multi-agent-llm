🚀 Setting Up the GitHub Repository for AI Playground

A well-structured GitHub repository ensures easy collaboration, version control, and deployment automation. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to set up, organize, and manage the repository.

🔹 1. Create the Repository

✅ Step 1: Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
✅ Step 2: Name it something like ai-playground.
✅ Step 3: Select:
	•	Public (if open-source) OR Private (for restricted access).
	•	Initialize with a README (so it’s not empty).
	•	Add .gitignore → Select “Rust” (for backend) & “Node” (for frontend).

✅ Step 4: Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-playground.git
cd ai-playground

🔹 2. Repository Structure

A clean structure helps separate concerns and keeps the project organized.

ai-playground/
│── backend/               # Rust-based AI backend
│   ├── src/               # Rust source code
│   ├── migrations/        # Database migrations
│   ├── Cargo.toml         # Rust dependencies
│   ├── Dockerfile         # Backend deployment config
│   ├── .env.example       # Example env variables
│── frontend/              # Next.js frontend
│   ├── pages/             # Next.js routes
│   ├── components/        # Reusable UI components
│   ├── public/            # Static assets
│   ├── package.json       # Frontend dependencies
│   ├── tailwind.config.js # Styling config
│   ├── .env.local.example # Example frontend env variables
│── docs/                  # Documentation & API guides
│── scripts/               # Deployment & automation scripts
│── .github/               # GitHub Actions (CI/CD workflows)
│── .gitignore             # Ignored files for version control
│── README.md              # Project overview & setup instructions

🔥 Now, everything is neatly separated!

🔹 3. Setup Branching Strategy

To keep code clean & organized, follow Git Flow:

✅ Main Branches
	•	main → Stable production-ready code.
	•	dev → Ongoing development, testing new features.

✅ Feature Branches

Create branches for each new feature/fix:

git checkout -b feature/websockets

After work is complete, merge it back to dev:

git checkout dev
git merge feature/websockets

Once tested, merge dev → main.

🔥 Now, all work is tracked and doesn’t break production!

🔹 4. Add Environment Variables for Security

NEVER store API keys or secrets in the repo. Instead, use .env files:

Backend (backend/.env.example)

DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

Frontend (frontend/.env.local.example)

NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:3000/ws/chat

✅ Do NOT commit .env files:

echo ".env" >> .gitignore

🔥 Now, secrets are safe and not exposed in GitHub!

🔹 5. Setup CI/CD with GitHub Actions

✅ Automate backend & frontend testing, deployment, and security checks.

Create .github/workflows/backend.yml

name: Backend CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - dev
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Rust
        uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable

      - name: Build & Test Backend
        run: |
          cd backend
          cargo build --release
          cargo test

🔥 Now, GitHub Actions automatically builds & tests the backend on every push!

🔹 6. Set Up Remote Repository & Push Code

✅ First-time setup

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-playground.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

✅ Pushing new changes

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin dev  # Pushes changes to dev branch

🔥 Now, the repo is live, and new features are tracked!

🚀 FINAL FINAL GITHUB REPO REVIEW: Did We Miss Anything?

🔥 WE JUST CRUSHED THAT! But… one last sweep for anything missing before we call it perfect!

🛠️ What Else Can We Add to the GitHub Repository?

1️⃣ Contributor Guidelines (For Clean & Consistent Code)

✅ Problem: If multiple people contribute, we need a clear coding style and rules to prevent messy commits.
✅ Solution: Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file with clear instructions on how to commit code, write docs, and submit PRs.

🔹 Create CONTRIBUTING.md

# Contributing to AI Playground 🎉

## 🔹 Branching Strategy
- **`main`** → Stable, production-ready code.
- **`dev`** → Active development branch.
- **Feature branches** (e.g., `feature/websockets`) → Use for new features.

## 🔹 Code Style
- **Rust:** Follow [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) conventions.
- **JavaScript/React:** Use Prettier (`npm run format` before commits).

## 🔹 Submitting Pull Requests
1️⃣ Always **create a feature branch** (e.g., `feature/add-auth`).  
2️⃣ Ensure all **tests pass** before pushing (`cargo test` or `npm test`).  
3️⃣ Open a **pull request (PR)** to `dev`, not `main`.  
4️⃣ Request a **code review** from another contributor before merging.  

🔥 Now, all contributors follow the same workflow = Fewer conflicts!

2️⃣ GitHub Project Board (Kanban for Task Tracking)

✅ Problem: We don’t have a visual roadmap of tasks.
✅ Solution: Use GitHub Projects to organize work into To-Do, In Progress, Done.

🔹 Set up columns:
✅ To-Do: Features/issues that need to be implemented.
🛠 In Progress: Features currently being worked on.
🚀 Done: Completed & merged features.

🔥 Now we have a clear roadmap of what’s happening at a glance!

3️⃣ Pre-Commit Hooks (Prevent Bad Commits)

✅ Problem: Developers might commit code that doesn’t follow formatting rules or contains errors.
✅ Solution: Use Husky (for JS) + Pre-Commit Hooks (for Rust) to auto-format & check for errors before commits.

🔹 Install Husky (Frontend)

npx husky-init && npm install

🔹 Modify .husky/pre-commit for frontend

#!/bin/sh
npx prettier --write .
npm run lint

🔹 Add Pre-Commit Hook for Rust (Backend)

cargo install pre-commit
pre-commit install

🔥 Now, commits will be blocked if the code isn’t clean!

4️⃣ Issue Templates (Standardized Bug Reports & Feature Requests)

✅ Problem: If someone reports a bug, we need structured info to fix it quickly.
✅ Solution: Use GitHub Issue Templates for bugs & feature requests.

🔹 Create .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md

---
name: "🐛 Bug Report"
about: Report a bug so we can fix it!
title: "[Bug] Short Description"
labels: bug
assignees: ""
---

## 🐛 Bug Description
A clear and concise description of what happened.

## 🔄 Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '...'
3. See error '...'

## 📸 Screenshots
(If applicable, add screenshots here.)

## 🖥 Environment
- OS: [e.g., Windows/Mac/Linux]
- Browser: [e.g., Chrome, Safari]
- Version: [e.g., v1.2.3]

🔥 Now every bug report follows a standard format for easy debugging!

5️⃣ Automated Dependency Updates (Keep Packages Up-to-Date)

✅ Problem: Dependencies can become outdated and introduce security risks.
✅ Solution: Use GitHub Dependabot to automatically check & update dependencies.

🔹 Enable Dependabot (.github/dependabot.yml)

version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "cargo"
    directory: "/backend"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"

  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/frontend"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"

🔥 Now, we’ll get automatic PRs when dependencies need updates!
